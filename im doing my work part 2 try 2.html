<p>Despite the challenges posed by these factors, the UAE has made outstanding efforts over the past decades to build an agricultural sector that is better able to contribute to food diversity and the national economy by adopting policies that limit the impact of these factors and adopt sustainable and climate smart agriculture methods that focus on the optimal utilization of the cultivated land and the quality of local produce to enhance its competitiveness. In general, these policies are based on innovative technologies and solutions, such as hydroponics, aquaponics and organic agriculture, in addition to strengthening agricultural pest control programs, reducing loss and waste throughout the food chain and expanding interest in scientific studies and research in the agricultural field.</p>
	<aside>The <strong>UAE</strong> currently satisfies about 60% of its domestic fruit and vegetable demand.
	  <section>The Ministry of <strong>Agriculture</strong> and Fisheries reported a 48% increase in vegetable production between 1992 and 1995.</section>
	</aside>
	<div>Agroforestry, intercropping, crop rotation, cover cropping, traditional organic composting and integrated crop-animal farming are prominent traditional agricultural practices.</div>
